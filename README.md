# happi-file-sync-gh ðŸ˜œ

Automatically sync specified files between github repositories.

## Features

- Automatically raise Pull Requests in a target repository when changes are made to monitored files.

## Usage

This is a GitHub Action that automatically syncs files between repositories by creating pull requests.

### Setup

1. Create a `.github/workflows/sync-files.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml
name: Sync Files
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or any branch you want to monitor
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering of the workflow

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: happi-file-sync-gh@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Token is passed as an input parameter
          file-mappings: |
            {
              "config": {
                "sourcePath": "config",
                "sourceFilename": "settings.json",
                "destRepo": "other-org/other-repo",
                "destPath": "config",
                "destFilename": "settings.json"
              },
              "docs": {
                "sourcePath": "docs",
                "sourceFilename": "README.md",
                "destRepo": "other-org/other-repo",
                "destPath": "documentation",
                "destFilename": "README.md"
              }
            }

```

### Configuration

The `file-mappings` input is a JSON object where each key is a unique identifier for the mapping, and the value contains:

- `sourcePath`: Directory path in the source repository (use `"."` for files in the root directory)
- `sourceFilename`: Name of the file to sync
- `destRepo`: Target repository in format `owner/repo`
- `destPath`: Directory path in the destination repository (use `"."` for files in the root directory)
- `destFilename`: Name of the file in the destination repository

Example with a file in the root directory:
```json
{
  "root-file": {
    "sourcePath": ".",
    "sourceFilename": "package.json",
    "destRepo": "other-org/other-repo",
    "destPath": ".",
    "destFilename": "package.json"
  }
}
```

### How it Works

1. When changes are pushed to the monitored branch, the action will:
   - Check for changes in the specified source files
   - Create a new branch in the destination repository
   - Copy the updated file(s) to the destination repository
   - Create a pull request with the changes

2. Pull requests will be created with:
   - Branch name: `sync-{sourceFilename}-{destFilename}`
   - Title: `Sync {sourceFilename} from source repository`
   - Description: Automatic sync notification

### Permissions

The action requires:
- `github-token` input parameter with access to both source and destination repositories (required)
  - For source repository: Read access to repository contents
  - For destination repository: Write access to create branches and pull requests
- Make sure your token has the following permissions:
  - `contents: write` - To create and update files
  - `pull_requests: write` - To create pull requests
  
Note: The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by GitHub Actions only has access to the current repository. If you need to sync files to a different repository, you'll need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with access to both repositories and store it as a repository secret.

Example workflow using a PAT:
```yaml
- uses: happi-file-sync-gh@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.SYNC_PAT }}  # Use a PAT with access to both repos
    file-mappings: |
      {
        "config": {
          "sourcePath": "config",
          "sourceFilename": "settings.json",
          "destRepo": "other-org/other-repo",
          "destPath": "config",
          "destFilename": "settings.json"
        }
      }
```
